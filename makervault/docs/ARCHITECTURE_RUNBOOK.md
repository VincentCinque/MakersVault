# MakersVault Architecture and Delivery Runbook

**Status:** Governing working document

**Baseline date:** 2026-08-13

**Committed baseline:** `main` at `80ddc5bb8849c0532ecf4de91010e450df28b940`

**Target:** v5.1 and the strategic roadmap that follows it

**Product promise:** **The self-hosted workspace for everything you make.**

## 1. Purpose

This is the execution runbook for turning the MakersVault strategy into working,
recoverable software. It governs the order of work, the evidence required to call
work complete, the decisions that require owner input, and the way the plan is
updated after each milestone.

It is intentionally founded on gates and truth:

- A roadmap item is not complete because code exists. It is complete when its
  behavior, migration, security, recovery, documentation, and evidence pass a
  defined gate.
- Current source and repeatable runtime evidence outrank an architectural wish.
- An assumption stays an assumption until it is tested or explicitly decided.
- A failed gate changes the plan; it is not explained away.
- After every accepted gate, MakersVault is re-baselined before the next gate is
  started.

This document is the operational companion to:

- [MakersVault_v5.1_Competitive_Strategy(1).md](MakersVault_v5.1_Competitive_Strategy(1).md)
- [PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md](PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md)
- [V5.1_SCOPE.md](V5.1_SCOPE.md)
- [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)
- [SUSTAINABILITY.md](SUSTAINABILITY.md)
- [MakersVault_v5.1_Security_Analysis.md](MakersVault_v5.1_Security_Analysis.md)

If those documents disagree about product intent, the product strategy and
explicit owner decision govern. If they disagree about current behavior, verified
source and runtime evidence govern. The disagreement must be recorded and the
stale document corrected at the active gate.

## 2. End state

The roadmap is satisfied when MakersVault is a trustworthy, self-hosted workshop
system of record in which a user can:

- Find and organize a large, mixed-discipline library without preview stalls.
- Understand what an item is, who created it, where it came from, and whether its
  content has changed.
- Keep primary files, visible supporting material, revisions, and useful
  fabrication context together.
- Group artifacts into projects and express a small set of useful relationships.
- Open supplied files in trusted local applications without MakersVault silently
  controlling a machine.
- Back up, verify, export, and restore the complete vault without a paid service.
- Operate the application with secure defaults and a documented upgrade path.
- Optionally buy operational convenience without losing the complete open-source,
  self-hosted product.

This is a directional end state, not permission to build every future subsystem
at once. Each capability remains behind its gate.

## 3. Non-negotiable product invariants

Every design and implementation gate must preserve these rules:

1. MakersVault does not slice models, send fabrication jobs, or start machines.
2. Prepared-print payloads remain internal. The user sees useful context such as
   `Prepared for Bambu Lab P1S · PLA · 0.4 mm · 3h 12m`, not a G-code browser.
3. Supporting documents remain visible and retrievable.
4. Users are not required to upload thumbnails. Preview extraction, bounded
   generation, caching, fallback, and failure handling belong to MakersVault.
5. Mounted no-copy libraries are never silently moved, renamed, or rewritten.
6. Duplicate detection may suggest; it does not silently merge or delete.
7. Original files and metadata remain portable without a subscription.
8. Local application integrations open supplied files; they do not create hidden
   machine-control authority.
9. No temporary `AssetGroup` layer is introduced. Evolution proceeds toward
   `Project -> Artifact -> Artifact Revision` when that architecture reaches its
   gate.
10. A difficult or hostile file must not make the rest of the library unusable.

A proposal that breaks an invariant stops until the owner changes the product
decision explicitly and the strategy documents are updated.

## 4. Truth protocol

### 4.1 Evidence order

When sources disagree, use this order:

1. Repeatable runtime result against the named build and data fixture.
2. Passing automated test that asserts the behavior directly.
3. Current executable source, migration, and deployment configuration.
4. Recorded architecture decision accepted by the owner.
5. Current product and release documents.
6. Issue, comment, recollection, or assumption.

Higher evidence does not make an unsafe design acceptable. It only establishes
what is true now.

### 4.2 Truth states

Every material claim used to approve work carries one of these states:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `VERIFIED` | Reproduced or directly proven in the named baseline. |
| `OBSERVED` | Seen once, but not yet protected by repeatable evidence. |
| `ASSUMED` | Needed for planning and not yet proven. Cannot satisfy a gate. |
| `PROPOSED` | A candidate design awaiting decision or evidence. |
| `DECIDED` | Explicitly accepted product or architecture direction. |
| `BLOCKED` | Cannot proceed safely without a dependency or owner decision. |
| `SUPERSEDED` | Was valid, but a newer accepted record replaced it. |

### 4.3 Required gate record

Every gate uses this record in its work log or pull request:

```text
Gate:
Status: PROPOSED | READY | IN PROGRESS | EVIDENCE REVIEW | ACCEPTED | REWORK
Baseline commit/image/database fixture:
Objective:
Verified entry conditions:
Assumptions to test:
Owner decisions required:
Files and data affected:
Migration and rollback plan:
Security and privacy impact:
Evidence produced:
Acceptance criteria result:
Documentation updated:
Residual risks and deferrals:
Accepted by/date:
Next-gate recommendation:
```

No gate may be marked `ACCEPTED` with an unlabelled assumption standing in for an
acceptance criterion.

## 5. Verified architecture baseline

This section records the starting truth for the runbook. It must be refreshed at
Gate 0 and after every accepted gate.

### 5.1 Baseline qualification

The committed anchor is `80ddc5bb8849c0532ecf4de91010e450df28b940`, but the
working tree also contains the in-progress v5.1 UI, metadata, storage, preview,
and model-bundle work. Therefore the commit alone is not a reproducible release
baseline. Gate 0 must preserve the work, identify generated output, and create a
named clean baseline before feature gates proceed.

### 5.2 Current component map

```text
Browser
  React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + Three.js/OCCT
                 |
                 | HTTP/JSON and file responses
                 v
FastAPI application
  route-heavy API + auth + import/storage/model services
          |                         |
          v                         v
SQLite metadata              Managed filesystem storage
                              + external mounted no-copy files

Browser custom protocol link
          |
          v
Go desktop bridge -> local slicer or engraving application
```

The target is a well-factored modular monolith, not a fleet of microservices.
Background work may run in a separate process later, but domain boundaries are to
be made explicit before deployment boundaries are multiplied.

### 5.3 Truth ledger

| ID | State | Current truth | Primary evidence | Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-001 | `VERIFIED` | The API is Python 3.11, FastAPI, SQLModel, and SQLite by default. | `api/requirements.txt`, `api/db.py` | SQLite-safe migrations and recovery are release requirements. |
| T-002 | `VERIFIED` | The web client is React/Vite and performs substantial preview work in the browser. | `web/package.json`, `web/src/ui/ModelViewer.tsx`, `AssetGrid.tsx` | Preview work needs hard budgets and persisted outcomes. |
| T-003 | `VERIFIED` | Production web packaging is a static build served by unprivileged Nginx with runtime API configuration. | `web/Dockerfile`, `web/nginx.conf`, `web/40-runtime-config.sh` | The security report's Vite-production finding must be revalidated and likely retired. |
| T-004 | `VERIFIED` | Production deployment separates `/app/data` and `/app/storage`; development layout differs. | Docker Compose files | Backup instructions must distinguish production and development. |
| T-005 | `VERIFIED` | Published deployment examples contain known fallback admin credentials and signing secrets. | deploy Compose files and `.env.example` | Fresh-production secret handling is a v5.1 blocker. |
| T-006 | `VERIFIED` | Auth is one environment-configured administrator with 12-hour HS256 JWTs. There is no user, role, revocation, or MFA model. | `api/auth.py`, models | Multi-user security is a later dedicated architecture gate. |
| T-007 | `VERIFIED` | Some file handoffs place bearer material in URLs, including custom-protocol handoff. | API schemas/routes and bridge code | Replace broad reusable bearer URLs with narrow, short-lived grants. |
| T-008 | `VERIFIED` | The bridge accepts custom protocol input, downloads a URL, caches the result, and launches a local application. | `slicer-bridge` source | The bridge is a workstation trust boundary and needs protocol hardening. |
| T-009 | `VERIFIED` | Current startup schema evolution uses `create_all` plus manual SQLite column/index changes and backfills. | `api/db.py` | A formal schema-version and migration mechanism precedes larger model changes. |
| T-010 | `VERIFIED` | Metadata is split between SQLite and filesystem content; updates are not one atomic transaction. | API storage and asset services | File mutations require staging, compensation, and reconciliation. |
| T-011 | `VERIFIED` | Current records are `Folder`, `Asset`, `AssetFile`, and `AppConfig`; several JSON structures are stored as text. | `api/models.py` | Project/revision work must migrate rather than replace data in place. |
| T-012 | `VERIFIED` | Managed primary files, thumbnails, and bundles use different storage layouts; no-copy records reference external paths. | asset/file services | Backup completeness and storage invariants must be explicit. |
| T-013 | `VERIFIED` | Mounted scans deduplicate primarily by source path and report details to process logs. | `api/mount_import.py` | A durable scan job/report is required for v5.1 observability. |
| T-014 | `VERIFIED` | URL import performs important address checks, but redirect and DNS behavior still need adversarial tests. | `api/url_utils.py`, security review | SSRF safety is proven by tests at the security gate, not presumed. |
| T-015 | `VERIFIED` | Prepared payloads and visible supporting files already have distinct roles and response behavior. | `AssetFile`, prepared-print and ZIP services | Visibility/download invariants need regression tests. |
| T-016 | `VERIFIED` | There is no established source-owned automated test suite or CI workflow, and web scripts provide no test/type-check command. | repository search, `web/package.json` | Gate 0 establishes the minimum safety harness. |
| T-017 | `VERIFIED` | Large route and UI files concentrate behavior in `api/main.py` and `AssetGrid.tsx`. | source inventory | New work should extract seams incrementally; no rewrite gate is authorized. |
| T-018 | `VERIFIED` | Multiple deployment manifests and tracked/generated runtime artifacts create truth drift. | repository status and manifests | Gate 0 names canonical artifacts and repository policy. |
| T-019 | `DECIDED` | v5.1 is single-admin; multi-user/MFA/SSO is deferred. | product strategy and v5.1 scope | Security analysis statements that assume v5.1 multi-user are stale. |
| T-020 | `DECIDED` | v5.1 is a confidence release, not the Project/Revision rewrite. | v5.1 scope | Reliability gates outrank future architecture work. |

### 5.4 Current storage invariants

Until a later gate changes them deliberately:

- SQLite holds identity and metadata; it is essential backup data.
- Managed primary files live under the configured storage template.
- Generated thumbnails live under managed thumbnail storage and may be
  regenerated, but retaining them improves restore fidelity and performance.
- Supporting and prepared files live under per-asset bundle storage.
- A prepared file is internal and excluded from normal browse/download surfaces.
- Mounted no-copy content remains outside the vault backup unless separately
  captured by the operator.
- `storage_path` and `source_path` behavior must remain compatible through v5.1.

                                    bounded workers/reconcilers

Short-lived, file-scoped handoff grant -> desktop bridge -> approved local app
```

Key rules:

- Route handlers translate HTTP; they do not own domain policy.
- Domain policy does not depend on React, FastAPI, SQLite SQL, or a concrete
  storage path.
- Storage is addressed through a small interface before S3-compatible storage is
  considered.
- Expensive or resumable work has durable job state and idempotent operations.
- The bridge receives a narrow handoff capability, not a general-purpose bearer
  token and arbitrary download authority.
- Components remain deployable as one API process until evidence justifies a
  separate worker.

### 6.2 Target logical model

The long-term logical direction is:

```text
Project
  `-- Artifact
        `-- ArtifactRevision
              +-- ArtifactFile -> ContentBlob
              +-- Preview (derived)
              +-- SourceReference / provenance
              `-- PreparedPrint (internal role and metadata)

Project/Artifact -- Relationship --> Project/Artifact
Artifact/Revision -- OpenWithPolicy --> ApplicationAdapter
PreparedPrint ---- Machine context --> MachineProfile (descriptive)
```

This is a logical target, not a finalized table schema. Gate 6 decides revision
ownership rules; Gate 7 decides project migration and relationships. In
particular, whether a supporting document belongs to an artifact or one revision
must be proven through real workflows before tables are committed.

Content identity and logical identity are separate:

- A `ContentBlob` is immutable bytes identified by SHA-256, size, and media type.
- An `Artifact` is the user's named thing and can change over time.
- An `ArtifactRevision` records a historical state.
- An `ArtifactFile` gives content a role and user-facing filename.
- A folder, collection, and tags organize items; they do not define byte identity.

Physical content-addressed storage is optional. SHA-256 identity must not force a
storage-layout migration before it is valuable.

### 6.3 Compatibility policy

- v5.1 API changes are additive wherever practical.
- Stored files are not relocated merely to make a schema look cleaner.
- New columns are nullable or safely defaulted during expansion.
- Data is backfilled and verified before old representations are contracted.
- Destructive schema contraction occurs only in a later release with a tested
  backup/restore path.
- Downgrade recovery may be restore-from-backup rather than a lossy reverse
  migration; that fact must be explicit in release notes.

## 7. Gate operating model

### 7.1 Gate lifecycle

```text
PROPOSED -> READY -> IN PROGRESS -> EVIDENCE REVIEW -> ACCEPTED
                \                         |
                 +------ REWORK <---------+
```

`READY` means entry evidence exists, open owner decisions are resolved, and
migration/rollback plans are written. `ACCEPTED` means exit evidence has been
reviewed and the truth ledger has been updated.

Only one roadmap gate is active at a time unless the owner explicitly authorizes
parallel work with independent data and rollback boundaries.

### 7.2 Stop and ask checkpoints

Implementation stops for owner input when a gate requires:

- A change to a product invariant or explicit non-goal.
- A destructive or externally visible data-retention decision.
- A user-facing terminology or workflow choice with materially different product
  meaning.
- A new external service, recurring cost, telemetry, or paid-service dependency.
- A new trust boundary, remote access posture, or machine-control capability.
- An irreversible migration whose safer alternative materially changes scope.
- Reprioritization because the evidence makes the active roadmap order unsound.

Routine implementation choices inside an accepted gate do not require repeated
approval; they require evidence at exit.

### 7.3 Definition of done for every gate

Unless a gate explicitly proves an item irrelevant, completion requires:

- Acceptance criteria tied to tests or a reproducible manual protocol.
- Upgrade from a representative prior-version database and storage fixture.
- Failure-path coverage, not only a happy path.
- Security review of changed trust boundaries and file handling.
- Backup/restore implications documented.
- User-visible behavior and operator documentation updated.
- Build and packaging evidence for affected components.
- No unexplained new warning, generated artifact, or dirty migration output.
- Truth ledger, risk register, and next gate re-baselined.

## 8. Sequenced roadmap gates

### Gate 0 — Establish the reproducible baseline and safety harness

**Current execution:** `EVIDENCE REVIEW` as of 2026-08-13. Local evidence is in
[evidence/gate-0/RESULTS.md](evidence/gate-0/RESULTS.md). ADR acceptance, an
immutable baseline commit, and its remote CI result remain before `ACCEPTED`.

**Objective:** Turn the current working version into a named, reproducible
baseline that can be changed without guessing.

**Entry truth:** v5.1 feature work exists in a dirty working tree; the repository
has no established automated test/CI contract, formal schema versioning, or single
canonical deployment manifest.

**Required work:**

- Preserve and inventory current user-owned changes before cleanup.
- Separate source, release artifacts, generated web output, runtime databases,
  caches, and local binaries in repository policy.
- Name the canonical development and production Compose manifests; remove or
  explicitly generate duplicates in a later reviewed change.
- Record an architecture/component map and configuration inventory.
- Introduce a formal schema version and ordered migration runner suitable for
  SQLite. Select Alembic or a small versioned migration system through an ADR.
- Create representative pre-v5.1 and current database/storage fixtures with no
  private user content.
- Establish API test, web build/type-check/test, bridge build/test, and container
  smoke-test commands.
- Add CI that executes the same source-owned commands used locally.
- Revalidate every security finding against current source and mark it confirmed,
  fixed, stale, or needing runtime proof.

**Exit evidence:**

- A clean, tagged or committed baseline can be recreated from source.
- One documented command set verifies API, web, bridge, and containers.
- A fresh database and representative old database reach the same declared schema
  version through repeatable migration.
- Canonical manifests and generated-artifact ownership are unambiguous.
- The security analysis no longer contradicts current source without a recorded
  discrepancy.

**Owner checkpoint:** approve the canonical deployment path and migration-system
ADR.

**Rollback:** Gate 0 must not transform user libraries. Tooling and repository
policy can be reverted while the preserved working snapshot remains recoverable.

### Gate 1 — Harden v5.1 trust boundaries and deployment

**Objective:** Make a fresh v5.1 deployment safe by default for its stated
single-admin, self-hosted scope.

**Dependencies:** Gate 0 accepted.

**Required work:**

- Remove known production credential/signing-secret fallbacks and define a clear
  first-run or explicit-environment setup path.
- Fail startup with actionable guidance when production security configuration is
  missing or known-unsafe.
- Upgrade and verify vulnerable direct dependencies; record the dependency scan.
- Add application-level upload, archive-entry, aggregate expansion, image, model,
  time, and storage budgets.
- Validate every URL import redirect and resolved connection target against SSRF
  policy; test redirect and DNS-change cases.
- Prevent mounted copy mode from escaping the configured root through symlinks.
- Design a short-lived, file-scoped handoff grant. The bridge must reject arbitrary
  origins/files and never accept a general MakersVault session token as its long-
  term contract.
- Reassess browser token storage, query-string propagation, login throttling, and
  session invalidation for the single-admin threat model. Resolve what can be
  changed compatibly in v5.1 and record a dated residual risk for anything that
  properly depends on the Gate 11 session architecture.
- Document trusted-LAN, reverse-proxy, HTTPS, and direct-Internet exposure posture.
- Keep multi-user, roles, MFA, and SSO out of this gate.

**Exit evidence:** all confirmed v5.1 P0 security findings have a regression test
or documented compensating control; malicious upload/import fixtures remain
bounded; a default production launch cannot unknowingly use published secrets;
bridge abuse tests demonstrate the narrowed trust boundary.

**Owner checkpoint:** choose the first-run administrator experience and supported
remote-access posture.

**Rollback:** configuration changes use a compatibility window for existing
deployments. A documented environment migration restores service without reverting
to known credentials. File-format changes are not allowed in this gate.

### Gate 2 — Bound preview work and prove library responsiveness

**Objective:** Ensure no single model can freeze the library and cached libraries
remain fast.

**Dependencies:** Gates 0–1 accepted.

**Required work:**

- Create a non-private benchmark corpus: small, medium, large, malformed,
  multi-part, multi-plate, and image-heavy files.
- Capture baseline load time, interaction latency, active preview concurrency,
  memory, failure rate, cache hit rate, and repeated-visit behavior.
- Define size/complexity/time budgets per preview path.
- Persist preview state: pending, ready, failed with reason, skipped by policy, and
  retry requested.
- Keep library cards on bounded static previews; reserve interactive parsing for
  explicit detail view.
- Abort or isolate failed client work and verify navigation remains responsive.
- Verify embedded 3MF extraction, generated thumbnails, type-aware fallbacks, and
  preview modes across supported browsers.

**Exit evidence:** the benchmark report demonstrates bounded concurrency and
memory; pathological fixtures cannot block navigation; repeat visits primarily use
cached thumbnails; failure and retry behavior is visible and repeatable.

**Owner checkpoint:** approve the observable experience for files intentionally
skipped by safety policy. Numeric limits are evidence-driven and configurable
where installations reasonably differ.

**Rollback:** preview policy can fall back to cached/placeholder-only operation
without affecting original files or metadata.

### Gate 3 — Complete scalable organization workflows

**Objective:** Make large-library navigation and bulk work explicit, predictable,
and recoverable.

**Dependencies:** Gate 2 accepted.

**Required work:**

- Add active-folder breadcrumbs and verified nested-folder/search behavior.
- Add a visible selection toolbar with selected count, current-page selection,
  clear selection, move, tag, download, and conservative deletion.
- Define selection behavior across filters, folders, pagination, and partial API
  failures.
- Report progress and per-item failures without hiding successful work.
- Preserve human-readable names unique within a folder and safe filename rename
  behavior.
- Do not implement “all server matches” until an API-side bulk contract can operate
  without loading every ID into the browser.
- Keep permanent mass deletion constrained until the trash gate exists.

**Exit evidence:** end-to-end tests cover navigation, selection scope, mixed
success/failure, concurrent rename conflict, supporting/prepared visibility, and
destructive confirmation; a representative large library remains usable.

**Owner checkpoint:** approve conservative deletion behavior before Trash exists.

**Rollback:** bulk operations are individually idempotent or report exactly which
IDs changed. Partial failure must never invite blind retry of destructive work.

### Gate 4 — Make ingestion observable and establish content truth

**Objective:** Let operators understand mounted imports and, when stable, establish
rename-resistant identity and provenance.

**Dependencies:** Gates 0–3 accepted.

**Gate 4A, required for v5.1:**

- Add an explicit mounted-library rescan action.
- Persist scan status, start/end time, import mode, and imported/skipped/failed
  counts with bounded failure details.
- Make scan work resumable or safely repeatable; one bad file cannot abort a scan.
- Preserve path-based compatibility and no-copy source ownership.
- State copy versus index-in-place consequences before execution.

**Gate 4B, include only when 4A and release-critical work are stable:**

- Compute SHA-256 during new ingestion without an avoidable second full read.
- Backfill managed files through bounded, resumable jobs.
- Record unavailable, changed, and failed states for no-copy content.
- Store source URL, creator, and license provenance when known.
- Warn on matching content; never auto-merge or delete.

**Exit evidence:** repeated scans are explainable and do not duplicate unchanged
source paths; failure details are visible without container logs; hashing jobs are
bounded and restartable; known duplicate fixtures produce suggestions only.

**Owner checkpoint:** none for 4A within approved scope. Ask before introducing
automatic grouping, merging, or a license inference policy.

**Rollback:** scan records may be abandoned without altering sources. Hash and
provenance columns remain additive. A backfill can pause and resume safely.

### Gate 5 — Prove upgrade, recovery, and the v5.1 release

**Objective:** Release v5.1 only after the whole confidence-release promise works
as an upgrade, not just as a fresh demo.

**Dependencies:** Gates 0–4A accepted; Gate 4B is optional and must be explicitly
listed as included or deferred.

**Required work:**

- Define essential data, derived/rebuildable data, and external no-copy data.
- Write and execute stop, snapshot, upgrade, verify, rollback/restore, and clean-
  machine recovery procedures.
- Test migrations against representative pre-v5.1 libraries, including nested
  folders, old thumbnails, supporting files, prepared metadata, renamed files,
  missing external files, and interrupted prior work.
- Run the performance, security, import, organization, and bridge matrices on
  versioned release candidates.
- Publish versioned Docker and bridge artifacts with provenance and checksums.
- Finish changelog, release notes, security policy, contribution guide, issue
  templates, upgrade notes, and known limitations.
- Verify the repository can build those artifacts without relying on committed
  runtime data or unexplained generated output.

**Exit evidence:** a clean installation is restored from the documented backup;
an old representative installation upgrades without data loss; rollback via the
documented backup succeeds; every v5.1 P0 acceptance criterion has named evidence;
release artifacts match their source revision.

**Owner checkpoint:** approve the release candidate, known limitations, and any P1
deferrals. This is the v5.1 ship/no-ship gate.

**Rollback:** restore the pre-upgrade database and managed-storage snapshot as a
matched set. Never restore only one side of the pair.

### Gate 6 — Establish revisions and recoverable deletion

**Objective:** Add trustworthy history before adding the larger Project model.

**Dependencies:** v5.1 released; SHA-256 identity completed or included as the
first subgate.

**Required decisions:** current-revision semantics; metadata ownership between
artifact and revision; supporting-file versioning; preview retention; storage
layout; revision export; Trash retention and permanent-deletion policy.

**Exit evidence:** existing Assets migrate without byte relocation; revision
creation never overwrites historical bytes; restore and permanent deletion are
tested; mounted changed/missing content has explicit states; backup manifests
represent all revisions.

**Owner checkpoint:** approve metadata ownership and Trash retention before schema
implementation.

**Rollback:** use expand/migrate/verify/contract. Do not contract legacy Asset data
until at least one stable release has proven the new read/write path.

### Gate 7 — Introduce Projects and relationships

**Objective:** Represent the thing being built without creating an unnecessary
grouping layer.

**Dependencies:** Gate 6 accepted.

**Required work:**

- Validate Project, Artifact, and Artifact Revision terminology with real mixed-
  discipline examples.
- Define migration for every existing Asset: unassigned artifact, generated
  project, or explicit user-assisted grouping.
- Introduce a small relationship vocabulary only where it produces useful UI:
  `derived_from`, `source_of`, `documentation_for`, `assembly_of`, `attachment`.
- Define project provenance, export, deletion, restore, search, and permission
  inheritance before later multi-user work.
- Avoid arbitrary custom fields until common metadata is stable.

**Exit evidence:** representative existing libraries migrate without losing folder
organization; projects export and restore; relationships cannot orphan content;
the UI improves retrieval rather than merely exposing a graph editor.

**Owner checkpoint:** approve terminology, default migration experience, and first
relationship set.

**Rollback:** legacy artifact browsing remains available through the compatibility
window; project association is additive until verified.

### Gate 8 — Generalize trusted local application adapters

**Objective:** Evolve slicer/LightBurn handoff into a safe `Open with` contract for
workshop applications.

**Dependencies:** Gate 1 handoff grants proven; stable file roles from Gates 6–7.

**Required work:** define adapter manifest, supported roles/extensions, platform
support, arguments, installation, diagnostics, approval, and revocation; prove the
contract with several built-in adapters before publishing an SDK.

**Exit evidence:** adapters cannot fetch arbitrary URLs, claim unsupported roles,
or launch unapproved executables silently; slicer and LightBurn behavior remains
compatible; failures are diagnosable without exposing secrets.

**Owner checkpoint:** approve which applications qualify as built-in and whether
custom commands are permitted.

**Rollback:** adapter versions are explicit; the existing supported handoffs
remain available until replacements pass compatibility evidence.

### Gate 9 — Add descriptive machine context

**Objective:** Let MakersVault describe relevant workshop machines without
becoming a machine controller.

**Dependencies:** prepared-print and project models stable.

**Required work:** define descriptive profiles and their relationship to prepared
metadata and artifacts; keep network credentials, telemetry, queues, job dispatch,
and start/stop controls out of scope.

**Exit evidence:** deleting or changing a profile does not damage prepared files;
exports preserve references; the interface never implies a job was sent.

**Owner checkpoint:** approve the minimal common machine fields and terminology.

**Rollback:** machine references are optional and nullable.

### Gate 10 — Deliver portable backup and storage abstraction

**Objective:** Make the vault independently verifiable and restorable before any
managed backup offering.

**Dependencies:** project/revision schemas stable enough to version an archive.

**Required work:** specify the `.mvault` manifest and versioning, checksums,
essential/derived/external content, streaming export/import, interruption recovery,
compatibility policy, optional encryption boundary, and storage interface; evaluate
S3-compatible storage only against these requirements.

**Exit evidence:** large representative vaults export without unbounded memory,
verify independently, restore on a clean compatible instance, and clearly report
missing no-copy content; the format is documented and usable without a paid
service.

**Owner checkpoint:** approve archive compatibility, encryption ownership, and
whether S3 support enters this gate.

**Rollback:** export is read-only. Import stages and verifies before committing a
new vault state.

### Gate 11 — Evolve authentication deliberately

**Objective:** Add multiple users only when authorization, recovery, and auditing
can be treated as a coherent system.

**Dependencies:** stable project ownership semantics, formal migrations, secure
single-admin baseline, and restore drills.

**Sequence:** users and password hashing -> sessions/revocation -> roles and object
authorization -> MFA/API keys -> OIDC/SSO. Each arrow may be split into its own
release gate.

**Exit evidence:** deny-by-default authorization tests cover every resource path;
ownership migration is explicit; account recovery and last-admin safety are
documented; audit records avoid secrets; security review covers sharing, imports,
exports, bridge grants, and backups.

**Owner checkpoint:** approve tenancy, sharing, registration, account-recovery, and
administrator policies before schema work.

**Rollback:** expand the single-admin record into the new user model without
removing recoverability; never down-migrate password or ownership data lossy.

### Gate 12 — Enable sustainable optional services

**Objective:** Add paid convenience only after the free product can perform and
verify the same core ownership/recovery functions locally.

**Dependencies:** Gates 10–11 as required by the specific service; an operational
support plan and demonstrated demand.

**Required work:** apply every test in `SUSTAINABILITY.md`; isolate service
entitlements from core local capability; define encryption, deletion, export,
support, incident response, cost, and shutdown/exit behavior.

**Exit evidence:** a customer can stop paying and retain a complete usable export;
self-hosted core behavior has no artificial file/project limits; service failure
does not corrupt the local vault; operational costs and support obligations are
understood.

**Owner checkpoint:** explicit business approval for every external service,
vendor, recurring cost, telemetry category, and price model.

**Rollback:** services are optional adapters around open formats. Disabling an
entitlement must not disable local access or export.

### Gate 13 — End-state audit and re-cock

**Objective:** Demonstrate that the strategy documents' goals are met, record what
was learned, and deliberately create the next roadmap.

**Required evidence:** trace each product promise, invariant, roadmap capability,
security obligation, portability requirement, and sustainability commitment to
current behavior and tests; perform a clean install, representative upgrade,
disaster restore, portable export/import, and trust-boundary review.

**Exit:** every goal is `VERIFIED`, explicitly `SUPERSEDED` by owner decision, or
carried into the next roadmap with a reason and dependency. No silent omission is
allowed.

**Owner checkpoint:** accept the achieved end state and approve the newly
re-baselined roadmap. The runbook then returns to Gate 0 semantics for the next
major cycle.

## 9. Cross-cutting change runbooks

### 9.1 Database schema change

1. Name the old and new schema versions.
2. Create a sanitized prior-version fixture and matched storage tree.
3. Back up database and managed storage together.
4. Expand with nullable/default-safe structures.
5. Backfill in bounded, restartable units where data volume can be large.
6. Verify row counts, references, checksums, and application invariants.
7. Switch reads, then writes, with a documented compatibility window.
8. Test interruption at each phase and rerun safely.
9. Contract old structures only in a later release after restore evidence.
10. Record whether rollback is a reverse migration or snapshot restore.

SQLite foreign-key enforcement, transaction boundaries, and index behavior must
be tested explicitly rather than inferred from model declarations.

### 9.2 Database plus filesystem mutation

SQLite and the filesystem do not share an atomic transaction. Every operation
that changes both must use an explicit state machine:

```text
validate -> stage bytes -> verify -> commit metadata -> publish bytes -> reconcile
```

The exact order may vary, but failure at every boundary must leave either the old
state intact or a detectable, recoverable staged state. Use same-filesystem atomic
rename where available. Never overwrite the only copy before verification.

A reconciliation command/job must detect at least:

- Metadata pointing to missing content.
- Unreferenced staged or managed content.
- Size/hash mismatch.
- Missing external no-copy sources.
- Prepared payloads accidentally exposed as ordinary attachments.

### 9.3 Background or expensive work

Any hashing, preview, scan, import, backup, or restore job that can outlive one HTTP
request uses durable states:

```text
queued -> running -> succeeded
                  -> failed (reason, retryability)
                  -> canceled
```

Jobs require idempotency keys or equivalent duplicate protection, progress that
does not grow without bound, time/resource budgets, retry policy, and stale-worker
recovery. Moving work to a queue does not by itself make it safe.

### 9.4 API and client contract change

- Add fields before requiring them.
- Keep visibility and authorization decisions server-side.
- Never use a generic session bearer as a durable file URL.
- Return stable error codes for partial/bulk operations.
- Test an older supported client against the new API when compatibility is
  promised.
- Version the contract before a breaking change is unavoidable.

### 9.5 Import or parser change

- Treat remote servers, archives, models, images, and embedded metadata as hostile.
- Validate extension, detected type, size, count, nesting, expansion, and elapsed
  work independently.
- Validate each redirect and actual connection target.
- Keep credentials scoped to the intended destination and out of logs.
- Process failures per item and preserve an audit/report record.
- Prefer isolation and bounded fallbacks over attempting every file.

### 9.6 Release change

A release candidate is immutable. If its evidence fails, create another candidate.
For each candidate record source revision, dependency locks, container digests,
bridge checksums, schema range, supported upgrade origins, test results, known
limitations, and recovery instructions.

## 10. Evidence matrix

| Area | Minimum evidence |
|---|---|
| API/domain | Unit tests for policy; integration tests against a temporary SQLite database and storage tree. |
| Migration | Fresh install, oldest supported fixture upgrade, interrupted rerun, integrity queries, matched restore. |
| Web | Production build, type check, component/interaction tests, supported-browser smoke tests. |
| Preview/performance | Versioned corpus, repeatable script, timing/memory/concurrency/cache report. |
| Import/security | Malicious redirect, DNS, archive, symlink, oversized, malformed, and timeout fixtures. |
| Bridge | Protocol parser tests, origin/grant/file-role restrictions, platform build, local-launch smoke test. |
| Containers | Fresh deploy, upgrade deploy, non-root/runtime health, persistent-volume restart, configured reverse proxy. |
| Backup/export | Clean-machine restore, checksum failure, interruption, missing external source, version compatibility. |
| Documentation | Commands executed as written by someone starting from the declared prerequisites. |

Manual evidence is acceptable only where automation is impractical, and must name
the operator, build, environment, steps, expected result, actual result, and date.

## 11. Risk register

| Risk | Impact | Active mitigation gate |
|---|---|---|
| No formal migration/version framework | Data loss or irreproducible upgrades | Gate 0 |
| Dirty/generated artifacts obscure release source | Unreproducible builds and accidental data commits | Gate 0 |
| Duplicate deployment manifests drift | Operators run different architectures unknowingly | Gate 0 |
| Published credentials/signing fallback | Account and data compromise | Gate 1 |
| Broad bridge/custom-URI authority | Workstation file execution boundary abuse | Gate 1 |
| Hostile import/archive/image/model | SSRF, resource exhaustion, parser exposure | Gates 1–2 |
| Client-heavy preview pipeline | Frozen UI and repeated expensive work | Gate 2 |
| Database/filesystem partial failure | Missing, orphaned, or mismatched content | Gates 0 and 5; all data gates |
| Mounted no-copy dependencies | Incomplete backup and broken references | Gates 4–5 and 10 |
| Route/UI concentration | Regression risk and hard-to-test changes | Incremental extraction in each gate |
| Premature Project rewrite | v5.1 delay and unsafe migration | Gates 5–7 sequencing |
| Multi-user without authorization model | Cross-user data exposure | Gate 11 |
| Documentation drift | Decisions and implementation diverge | Every re-cock |
| Hosted service before portability/security | Lock-in and operational trust failure | Gates 10–12 |

Risks are never closed only because a feature shipped. Closure requires evidence;
accepted residual risk names its owner, reason, review date, and containment.

## 12. Architecture decision records

Material decisions use short ADRs under `docs/adr/` when their gate begins. Each
ADR records context, verified facts, decision, alternatives, consequences,
migration, rollback, and superseding conditions.

The initial required ADR queue is:

1. Canonical development and production deployment manifests.
2. SQLite schema versioning and migration mechanism.
3. Secure first-run single-admin configuration.
4. File-scoped browser-to-bridge handoff grants.
5. Preview budgets and persisted preview state.
6. Content identity and duplicate-suggestion semantics.
7. Artifact/revision metadata and attachment ownership.
8. Trash retention and permanent deletion.
9. Existing-Asset to Project/Artifact migration.
10. Portable archive compatibility and encryption boundary.
11. Multi-user tenancy and authorization model.

An ADR describes a decision; it does not replace implementation evidence.

## 13. Strategy traceability

This matrix prevents a goal from disappearing between documents and
implementation. Gate 13 closes the roadmap only when the listed proof exists.

| Source commitment | Delivery gates | Final proof |
|---|---|---|
| Preserve product boundaries and remain the workshop source of truth | All gates | Invariant regression audit and representative end-to-end workflows |
| Fast, resilient v5.1 library | Gates 2 and 5 | Published benchmark and pathological-file results |
| Easy organization at scale | Gates 3 and 5 | Large-library navigation and bulk-workflow tests |
| Models with context, visible supporting files, hidden prepared payloads | Gates 3–5 | Visibility, handoff, download/export, and migration tests |
| Mounted import observability | Gates 4A and 5 | Repeatable scan reports and no-copy safety tests |
| Secure defaults and trustworthy deployment | Gates 0, 1, and 5 | Revalidated security report, abuse tests, and fresh-production smoke test |
| Upgrade, backup, and recovery confidence | Gates 0 and 5 | Representative upgrade and matched database/storage restore |
| Content identity and provenance | Gate 4B, or first subgate of Gate 6 | Bounded hashing, integrity, and duplicate-suggestion evidence |
| Artifact history and recoverable deletion | Gate 6 | Revision, Trash, export, and restore evidence |
| `Project -> Artifact -> Artifact Revision` without `AssetGroup` | Gate 7 | Existing-library migration and project recovery evidence |
| Useful relationships and project provenance | Gate 7 | Retrieval workflows and round-trip export evidence |
| Safe general local application handoff | Gates 1 and 8 | Scoped-grant and multi-adapter conformance tests |
| Descriptive machine context without control | Gate 9 | Boundary and export tests; no command/telemetry authority |
| Open, portable backup and storage evolution | Gate 10 | Independently documented and verified `.mvault` round trip |
| Deliberate authentication evolution | Gates 1 and 11 | Authorization, recovery, session, and audit test suites |
| Complete open source plus paid convenience | Gate 12 | Sustainability decision tests and non-lock-in exit drill |
| All confirmed security findings resolved or explicitly accepted | Gates 0–2, 5, 8, 10–11 | Finding-by-finding evidence ledger with no unowned residual risk |

## 14. Re-cock protocol

After each gate is accepted:

1. Freeze the evidence against a commit or immutable release candidate.
2. Update the truth ledger with what is now verified, superseded, or still assumed.
3. Update the current component/data/deployment diagrams.
4. Reconcile the strategy, v5.1 scope, roadmap, security analysis, runbook, README,
   and operator documentation against the implementation.
5. Re-score risks and remove only those closed by evidence.
6. Record new debt and discoveries without silently expanding the completed gate.
7. Re-evaluate dependencies and the next gate's entry conditions.
8. Present owner decisions and scope choices together with evidence and a
   recommendation.
9. Mark the next gate `READY`, split it, reorder it, or leave it `BLOCKED`.
10. Update this document's baseline date and source revision.

The next gate begins only after this reset. A schedule may change; the product
invariants and evidence standard do not change silently.

## 15. Immediate next action

When code work is authorized, begin Gate 0. Do not begin by adding another product
feature. First preserve the current v5.1 working state, establish the clean
baseline, reconcile the security report, choose the migration mechanism and
canonical deployment path, and produce the minimum automated safety harness.

At the end of Gate 0, present its evidence and the two owner decisions for
acceptance. Then re-cock this runbook and proceed to Gate 1.
